# Structured Security Alerts from Live Network Traffic

## üéØ **Yes, Structured Alerts Are Generated from LIVE Network Traffic!**

Your structured security alerts are **dynamically generated in real-time** from your live network traffic, not from static data. Here's how the system works:

## üîÑ **Real-Time Alert Generation Process**

### 1. **Live Packet Capture**
- The packet sniffer continuously captures network packets from your Wi-Fi interface
- All network flows are analyzed in real-time as they occur
- No pre-existing data is used - everything is live!

### 2. **Real-Time Flow Analysis**
- Each network flow is analyzed for suspicious patterns
- Suspicious protocol/port combinations are detected instantly
- Threat scoring is calculated based on live traffic characteristics

### 3. **Instant Alert Generation**
- When suspicious flows are detected, structured alerts are generated immediately
- Each alert contains real-time data from the actual network traffic
- Alerts are saved to the database with live timestamps

## üìä **Live Data Sources**

### **From Your Network Interface:**
- **Source IP**: Your actual network devices (192.168.1.7, etc.)
- **Destination IP**: Real external servers and services
- **Protocol**: Actual protocols being used (TCP, UDP, etc.)
- **Ports**: Real destination ports from live connections
- **Timestamps**: Exact time when suspicious activity occurred
- **Bytes/Packets**: Real traffic volume from live flows
- **Direction**: Actual flow direction (Internal-to-External, etc.)
- **Country**: Real geographic locations from GeoIP lookups

### **Real-Time Detection Examples:**
```
‚úÖ TCP on DNS port (53) - Live DNS tunneling attempts
‚úÖ UDP on HTTP ports - Live protocol anomalies  
‚úÖ Telnet traffic (port 23) - Live insecure connections
‚úÖ SSH access (port 22) - Live remote access attempts
‚úÖ RDP access (port 3389) - Live remote desktop connections
‚úÖ Suspicious protocol combinations - Live unusual traffic patterns
```

## üö® **Live Alert Generation Triggers**

### **Automatic Detection:**
1. **Packet Sniffer** captures live network traffic
2. **Flow Analysis** identifies suspicious patterns in real-time
3. **Alert Generator** creates structured alerts immediately
4. **Database Storage** saves alerts with live timestamps
5. **Web Interface** displays alerts in real-time

### **Real-Time Processing:**
- **No delays**: Alerts are generated as suspicious flows are detected
- **No batch processing**: Each suspicious flow triggers an immediate alert
- **Live timestamps**: Every alert shows the exact time of detection
- **Real IP addresses**: Actual source and destination IPs from your network

## üìà **Live Alert Statistics**

### **Real-Time Metrics:**
- **Total Alerts**: Count of all alerts generated from live traffic
- **Recent Alerts (24h)**: Alerts from the last 24 hours of live monitoring
- **Severity Distribution**: Real-time breakdown of threat levels
- **Threat Type Distribution**: Live categorization of detected threats

### **Live Updates:**
- Statistics update automatically every 30 seconds
- New alerts appear immediately in the web interface
- Alert counts reflect real-time network activity
- Severity levels are calculated from live threat scoring

## üîç **Live Alert Details**

### **Each Alert Contains:**
- **Alert ID**: Unique identifier with live timestamp
- **Timestamp**: Exact time when suspicious flow was detected
- **Source IP**: Real IP address from your network
- **Destination IP**: Actual external server IP
- **Protocol**: Real protocol being used
- **Port**: Actual destination port
- **Packets/Bytes**: Real traffic volume
- **Threat Type**: Categorized based on live analysis
- **Anomaly Score**: Calculated from live traffic characteristics
- **Severity**: Risk level based on live threat assessment
- **Direction**: Actual flow direction
- **Country**: Real geographic location

## üéØ **Live Network Examples**

### **From Your Logs:**
```
Generated structured alert: ALERT_1750550706_62474CA0 - DNS Tunneling (HIGH)
Source: 192.168.1.7 (your device)
Destination: 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS)
Protocol: TCP on port 53
Time: Real timestamp when detected
```

### **Real Suspicious Flows Detected:**
- TCP connections to DNS port 53 (potential DNS tunneling)
- UDP traffic on HTTP ports (protocol anomalies)
- Connections to admin ports (22, 23, 3389)
- Unusual protocol/port combinations
- External connections to suspicious destinations

## üéâ **Summary**

Your structured security alerts are **100% generated from live network traffic**! The system:

1. **Captures** your real network packets in real-time
2. **Analyzes** live flows for suspicious patterns
3. **Generates** alerts immediately when threats are detected
4. **Stores** alerts with live timestamps and real data
5. **Displays** everything in real-time on the web interface

Every alert you see represents actual suspicious activity detected on your live network, not static or historical data!
